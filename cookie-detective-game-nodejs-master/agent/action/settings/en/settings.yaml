    Detective, find that cookie!

    Have your kids become kitchen sleuths as they locate their cookie friend under 10 guesses. Make sure the mouse doesn't get to the cookie first!

    After cracking the case, do the celebratory cookie dance before journeying to harder levels in space and under the sea. 

    This game supports both single and multiplayer modes.
